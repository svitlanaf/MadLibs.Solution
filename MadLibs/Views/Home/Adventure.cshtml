<h1>Here's your story!</h1>

<p>One day, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() were walking through the woods, when suddenly a giant @Model.GetAnimal() appeared. "@Model.GetExclamation()", @Model.GetPerson1() cried. The two of them @Model.GetVerb() as quickly possible, and when they were safe, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() gave each other a giant @Model.GetNoun().
<p>The End!</p>
